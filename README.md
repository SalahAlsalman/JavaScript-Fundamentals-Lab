### Variables
- The Age Calculator  
    - Store the current year in a variable.
    - Store your birth year in a variable.
    - Calculate the age based on the stored values.
    - Output to the screen like so: "Your age is NN".
# JavaScript conditions and loops

## Switch statement
- Declare a variable and assign number to it from 1 to 7
- Use switch statement to print the day's name based on its number (print "Sunday" if the number is 1, "Monday" if the number is 2, ...)



## If else statement
### even & odd numbers
- Declare a variable and assign number to it 
- Write if else statement to check if that number you entered is even or odd and print the result in the console

### Write this question using if else statment, that is if:

* Grade is 90 and above is an A 
* Grade of 80 to 89 is a B  
* Grade of 70 to 79 is a C  
* Grade of 60 to 69 is a D 
* Grade of 59 or below is a F


### Leap year
A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.
- Declare a variable and assign year to it 
- **Hint:** to know if the year is leap or not:
    - The year must be divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 OR the year divisible by 400 
- print appropriate message that show the year and if it's leap year or not



## For loop
### Fibonacci sequence: 

* Write a program that prints the first 20 elements of Fibonacci sequence: 

* Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, and the first two elements are 0 and 1

* it starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..

### squares of numbers
* using for loop print the squares of numbers from 1-10 

## Nested for loop
### Multiplication table
- Write a nested loop that print the multiplication table for number from 1-5


## While loop
### odd numbers
* Using while loop print odd numbers from 1-20
### power of 2
*  Using while Write a program that prints true if a number is a power of 2, and 0 otherwise
